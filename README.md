# The Hangry Angler
This repo includes the Arduino firmware to run the Hangry Angler, a fish that can sense what kind of prey it's about to eat! 

Check out the [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com) to learn how to try this awesome project made with DIY, low-fidelity sensors. The Hangry Angler is a great project to get started with roll-your-own sensors. Using simple materials like cardboard and circuit paint you can create your own ultra-custom sensors for just about anything you want.

Follow along and then remix it for your own sensing project!
